<p>I wanted to create and application to be a great calculator of all the mechanics thas involves a lot of number and calculus to answer some of my newcommer questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Is my level character damage good enough?</li>
<li>Am I doing the correct damage or something is wrong in my setup?</li>
<li>Are my skills good enough?</li>
<li>Should I rather focus on skilling or leveling or something in the middle?</li>
<li>How expensive is a set of imbues?</li>
<li>Are stronger imbues worth it?</li>
<li>How much is saved trough imbuements?</li>
<li>Why is it so hard to split loot? (of a party hunt)</li>
</ul>
<p>So I got to the conclusi√≥n that to solve those questions I needed an app that wasn't on the internet that answered thos questions</p>
<p>Reddit help something but I want the number calculus and statistics (and some of the wiki formluaes are obsolete and depricated)</p>
<p>I made a regresion statistic and numeric methods to unravel these formulaes to the most close of real formulaes and set them in the app</p>

<h2>Application that contains: </h2>
<h4>
<ol>
<li>Party loot</li>
<li>Rotation and main spells modifier per turn/battle</li>
<li>Damage calculator for knight, paladins and runes based on magic level with graphs of the scaling</li>
<li>Imbuing calculator (gold token, materials or mixed) and cost of hunt per hour</li>
</ol>
